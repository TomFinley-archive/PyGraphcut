<h1>License</h1>

<p>The underlying MAXFLOW code has its own license restricting distribution and use.  See <a href="http://www.cs.adastral.ucl.ac.uk/~vnk/software.html">graphcut code</a>.  To give an imperfect summary: the underlying code is restricted by a research only license.  Read the MAXFLOW license in <code>src/outside/README.txt</code> for more information.</p>

<p>PyGraphcut is a derivative work from MAXFLOW.  As such, in using it you are subject to the license of MAXFLOW.  PyGraphcut has no usage license terms of its own, however.  The implication is: you are licensed to use PyGraphcut if and only if you are licensed to use the underlying MAXFLOW software.</p>

<p>Note that the copyright for the code is distinct from the usage license.  All code and content within the PyGraphcut distribution archive outside the <code>src/outside</code> directory is copyright Thomas Finley at <code>tfinley@gmail.com</code>, while all code in <code>src/outside</code> is copyright of their own authors (in most cases either Boykov or Kolmogorov).</p>

<p>To summarize: the license is research only, but if you manage to get a relaxed license out of V. Kolmogorov, feel free to use PyGraphcut subject to the terms you negotiate with him.</p>
